Approximately how much time did you spend on this assignment (without EC)?
15 hour(s)

Which parts of this assignment were the hardest, and/or took the most time?
I spent most of the time finding bugs in write function implementation. The test client cannot receive the body of http response. I tried netcat and my own Java test client, it works fine. After consulting with TA, I found out I didn't set content-length header.

Optional: Do you have any suggestions for improving this assignment?
When write function is called, we should store the data in buffer instead of directly sending to the client. Suppose we set up this server as a HTML template server. After we use write to send "200 OK" and html header, if the template parser corrupts, client has no idea of the problem but received a 200 OK and a partially sent HTML file.
